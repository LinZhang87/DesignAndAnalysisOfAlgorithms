# DesignAndAnalysisOfAlgorithms
Coursera course offered by Standford University

Course Topics Part I
Vocabulary for design and analysis of algorithms 
  E.g., "Big-Oh" notation; "sweet spot" for high-level reasoning about algorithms

Divide and conquer algorithm design paradigm
  Apply to: Integer multiplication, sorting, matrix multiplication, closet pair
  General analysis methods("Master method/Theorem")
  
Randomization in algorithm design 
  Apply to: QuickSort, primality testing, graph partitioning, hashing
  
Primitives for reasoning about graphs 
  Connectivity information, shortest paths, structure of information and social networks
  
Use and implementation of data structures 
  Heaps, Balanced binary search trees, hashing and some variants(e.g., bloom filters)

Course Topics Part II
Greedy algorithm design paradigm 
Dynamic programming algorithm design paradigm
NP-complete problems and what to do about them
Fast heuristics with provable guarantees
Fast exact algorithms for special cases
Exact algorithms that beat brute-force search
